# Fix Lint and Formatting

## Instructions

1. Run `npm run prettier` to fix formatting
2. Run `npm run lint` to check for remaining lint issues
3. Report any remaining manual fixes needed

## Common Mistakes

- **Running prettier on wrong files** - `npm run prettier` only 
formats changed files
- **Ignoring lint errors** - These will fail CI, fix them before 
committing
